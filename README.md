# Tajik and Russian phonetic keyboard layouts for OSX/Windows

## Overview
Several years ago, when I got my MacBook, I quickly realized that I couldn't use my Latin keyboard to type in Russian, this encouraged me to create my own phonetic keyboard layout. My wife and I have been joyfully using it since. Recently I started to work on a Tajik online dictionary which required a lot of typing and I had to come up with way to use my Latin keyoabrd again. So based on my Russian phonetic layout I created the Tajik phonetic layout for OSX. In an effort to simplify and standardize the layouts I added support for both, OSX and Windows. I'm very hopeful people are going to find them useful.

The layout source files are available in this repository, feel free to download and reconfigure them per your personal preference. OSX version was created with **Ukelete** ([http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele)), the Windows version with **The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator** ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx)).

## Installation on Windows
1. Download the installation package for the layout you want: 
[Tajik](https://github.com/maqduni/Phonetic-Keyboard-Layouts/raw/master/dist/win-tajik-phonetic-keyboard.zip), 
[Russian](https://github.com/maqduni/Phonetic-Keyboard-Layouts/raw/master/dist/win-russian-phonetic-keyboard.zip)
2. Unpack and run setup.exe.
3. Open the language bar settings and set the layout as default, if necessary.

Done!

## Installation on OSX

2. If you wish to install the layout for the current user, unpack the package to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`. For all users, to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`. In order to go these folders directly you can use Finder's `Go to Folder` command (Cmd + Shift + G).
3. Add the installed layout as an `Input Source`, the layout appears unders `Others` category in the list of all available languages.

## Usage - Russian Layout

#### Russian keyboard has a very intuitive layout, the usual ЯШЕРТ layout is now ЯВЕРТ, which I find more convenient. The full layout is presented on the figures below
