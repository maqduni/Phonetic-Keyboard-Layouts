# Tajik standard and phonetic keyboard layouts for macOS (Mac OS X, OS X). Tajik phonetic keyboard layouts for Windows.

## Overview
Back in 2017 when I started working on the Tajik Persian online dictionary [Vazhaju|Вожаҷӯ](https://vazhaju.com/) I had to do lot of typing in Tajik. It was nearly impossible to get a Tajik keyboard in the US and it's just impractical to have several keyboards. I had to come up with way to use my Latin keyboard to type in Tajik. Based on a Russian phonetic layout I made a Tajik phonetic layout for macOS. Later upon a couple of requests I added the standard Tajik layout as well. In an effort to simplify the installation process, I made a package that contains all of the layouts for macOS and a separate installation package that contains Tajik phonetic layouts for Windows. Very hopeful they will come in handy to others just as much as to me.

The layout source files are available in this repository, feel free to download and reconfigure them per your personal preference. macOS version was created with **Ukelete** ([http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele)), the Windows version with **The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator** ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx)).
