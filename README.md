# Tajik and Russian phonetic keyboard layouts for OSX/Windows

## Overview
Several years ago, when I got my MacBook, I realized there were no Russian phonetic layouts for OSX, so I decided to create my own. My wife and I have been using it since then, but until recently when I created the Tajik phonetic keyboard layout I haven't thought of sharing it with anyone publicly. Now I'm sharing the layouts with others and I'm very hopeful people are going to find them useful.

In an effort to simplify and standardize the layouts I added support for both, OSX and Windows.

The layout source files are available in this repository, feel free to download and reconfigure them per your personal preference. OSX version was created by <b>Ukelete</b> ([http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele)), the Windows version by <b>The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator</b> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx]((https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx)).

## Installation on Windows
1. Download the installation zip file for the layout you want from [url].
2. Unpack and run setup.exe.
3. Open the language bar settings and set the layout as default, if necessary.

Done!

## Installation on OSX
1. Download the installation zip file for the layout you want from [url].
2. If you wish to install the layout for the current user, unpack the package to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`. For all users, to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`. In order to go these folders directly you can use Finder's `Go to Folder` command (Cmd + Shift + G).
3. Add the installed layout as an `Input Source`, the layout appears unders `Others` category in the list of all available languages.

Done!
