# Tajik and Russian phonetic keyboard layouts for OSX/Windows

## Overview
Several years ago, when I got my MacBook, I realized there were no Russian phonetic layouts for OSX, so I decided to create my own. My wife and I have been using it since then, but until recently when I created the Tajik phonetic keyboard layout I haven't thought of sharing it with anyone publicly. Now I'm sharing the layouts with others and I'm very hopeful people are going to find them useful.

In an effort to simplify and standardize the layouts I added support for both, OSX and Windows.

The layout source files are available in this repository, feel free to download and reconfigure them per your personal preference. OSX version was created with **Ukelete** ([http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele)), the Windows version with **The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator** ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx)).

## Installation on Windows
1. Download the installation package for the layout you want: 
[Tajik](https://github.com/maqduni/Phonetic-Keyboard-Layouts/raw/master/dist/win-tajik-phonetic-keyboard.zip), 
[Russian](https://github.com/maqduni/Phonetic-Keyboard-Layouts/raw/master/dist/win-russian-phonetic-keyboard.zip)
2. Unpack and run setup.exe.
3. Open the language bar settings and set the layout as default, if necessary.

Done!

## Installation on OSX
1. Download the installation package for the layout you want: 
[Tajik](https://github.com/maqduni/Phonetic-Keyboard-Layouts/raw/master/dist/osx-tajik-phonetic-keyboard.zip), 
[Russian](https://github.com/maqduni/Phonetic-Keyboard-Layouts/raw/master/dist/osx-russian-phonetic-keyboard.zip)
2. If you wish to install the layout for the current user, unpack the package to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`. For all users, to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`. In order to go these folders directly you can use Finder's `Go to Folder` command (Cmd + Shift + G).
3. Add the installed layout as an `Input Source`, the layout appears unders `Others` category in the list of all available languages.

Done!

## Usage

#### Russian keyboard has a very intuitive layout, the usual ЯШЕРТ layout is now ЯВЕРТ, which I find more convenient. The full layout is presented on the figures below
