# Tajik standard and phonetic keyboard layouts for OSX. Tajik phonetic keyboard layouts for Windows.

## Overview
Recently I started to work on a Tajik online dictionary which required a lot of typing so I had to come up with way to use my Latin keyboard to type in Tajik. Based on a Russian phonetic layout I created the Tajik phonetic layout for OSX. Later upon a couple of requests I added the standard Tajik layout as well. In an effort to simplify and standardize the layouts, I created a bundle that contains standard and phonetic layouts for OSX and a separate installation package that contains Tajik phonetic layouts for Windows. I'm very hopeful you will find them useful.

The layout source files are available in this repository, feel free to download and reconfigure them per your personal preference. OSX version was created with **Ukelete** ([http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele)), the Windows version with **The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator** ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx)).

## Installation on Windows
1. Download the installation package for the layout you want: 
[Windows Tajik Phonetic ЯВЕРТ](https://github.com/maqduni/Phonetic-Keyboard-Layouts/raw/master/dist/win-tajik-phonetic-keyboard.zip)
2. Unpack the zip package and run setup.exe.
3. Open the language bar settings and set the layout as default, if necessary.

NOTE: On Windows 10, you might have to enable the language bar in the `Control Panel -> Regional and Language Settings`.

Done! You can now choose the layout from the list of available input sources and type in Tajik.
